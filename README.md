# Summary
My Playlist is a community playlist maker. You can create a playlist and can add urls from different streaming sites such as youtube, soundcloud, and vimeo to make your playlist. The ideaa is that you can make a playlist and if someone else knows a good song that will go with the playlist you could add to it. If you add the artist and song name you can get the lyrics by pressing the get lyrics button and the lyrics will populate the bottom of the page. You can sort through all the playlist by genre.

# What Did I Learn
During this project I learned how to use React! This was my second full stack application but the first one I've made using client side rendering. I feel confident with pass props and using state in react now. The hardest part was planning out the components and what data would be sent to them and what actions they would do. React is an awesome tool and I plan to further my knowledge of react by learning redux and react native.

# Version 2
In version 2 I would add a user model so you would have to own the playlist if you wanted to edit the songs. I would also look into using an api to spotify.
